  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Thin.ttf
